<h1>Traffic Sign Recognition and Classification</h1>
<h3><i>This project was created as the final year B.Tech project</i></h3>

<p>In this project, we implemented a recognition and a classification model. The recognition system was used the darknet framework and the YOLO v3 model to detect traffic signs in a frame of a video. Whereas, the classification system was based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The YOLO model determined where the traffic sign was located in the frame and the CNN model determined the class of that traffic sign. We used a dataset with 21 classes of Traffic signs.</p>
